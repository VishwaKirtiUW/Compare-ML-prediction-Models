# Compare-ML-prediction-Models

We will be working with the World values Survey. It is a survey, conducted every few years in a number of countries. Here we use wave 6 data, mostly from 2013-2014. 
The survey contains data of volunteers regarding their values. The questions revolve around different opinion topics, including trust, work, religion, family, gender
equality, and nationalism. 

In this problem set we focus on what the respondents think about abortion:
The responses range between 1- never justifable, and 10 - always justifable.

We train 3 different ML models k-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression ad then compare the performance of the three models.
